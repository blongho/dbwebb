<h1>Lab 2 - python</h1>
<p>In this exercise we will look into flow-control. If-statements, for-loops and while-loops.</p>


<h2>1. Boolean operators and if-statements</h2>
<p>The basics of boolean operators and if-statements.</p>


<h3>Exercise 1.1 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create three variables representing dice values: <code>dice1</code> = 2, <code>dice2</code> = 6 and <code>dice3</code> = 2.</p>

<p>Answer with the boolean value of the expression &#8216;<code>dice1</code> is greater than <code>dice2</code>&#8217;.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.2 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Sum the three variables <code>dice1</code>, <code>dice2</code> and <code>dice3</code>.</p>

<p>Use an if-statement to decide if the sum of the three variables i greater than 11. If the sum is greater than 11 answer with &#8216;big&#8217; otherwise answer with &#8216;small&#8217;.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.3 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Add the sum of <code>dice4</code> = 2 and <code>dice5</code> = 1 to the sum of the three other dices.</p>

<p>Use an if, elseif, else statement to check the total value of the dices. Answer with &#8216;small&#8217; if the sum is smaller than 11, &#8216;intermediate&#8217; if the sum is greater than or equal to 11 but smaller than 21. If the sum is greater than or equal to 21 answer with &#8216;big&#8217;.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.4 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create a variable <code>summer_word</code> containing the word &#8216;resort&#8217;.</p>

<p>Answer with True if <code>summer_word</code> contains the letter &#8216;s&#8217; otherwise answer with False.</p>

<p>Tip: Use the <code>in</code> operator.</p>







<h2>2. For-loops</h2>
<p>The basics of iteration and for-loops.</p>


<h3>Exercise 2.1 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Loop through the numbers 0 to 10 (10 included) and concatenate a string with the numbers comma-separated. You should have a comma at the end of the string.</p>

<p>Answer with the string.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.2 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Loop through the letters of the variable <code>summer_word</code> from above. Concatenate the consonants from <code>summer_word</code> and answer with the new word.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.3 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Loop through all numbers from 22 to 80 both numbers included. Add all odd (udda) numbers together and answer with the result.</p>

<p>Tip: Use the modulus % operator.</p>







<h2>3. While-loops</h2>
<p>The basics of while-loops.</p>


<h3>Exercise 3.1 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create a while-loop that starts at value 4 and ends when the value is greater than 26, the value should be incremented by 3 for each iteration. Concatenate a string with the numbers comma-separated. You should have a comma at the end of the string.</p>

<p>Answer with the string.</p>






<h3>Exercise 3.2 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create a while-loop that adds 4 to the number 73, 26 times. Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 3.3 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create a while-loop that subtracts 5 from 40, 78 times. Answer with the result.</p>







<h2>4. Extra assignments</h2>
<p>These questions are worth 3 points each. Solve them for extra points.</p>


<h3>Exercise 4.1 (3 points)</h3>
<p>Use a for-loop or a while-loop to reverse the word &#8216;constitutionality&#8217;.</p>

<p>Answer with the reversed word.</p>






<h3>Exercise 4.2 (3 points)</h3>
<p>Swedish numberplates consist of three letters and three numbers. The numbers range from 001 to 999. Using one of the four common rules of arithmetics (+, -, *, /), how many of the numberplates can the two first numbers give the third number?</p>

<p>Examples:
&#8216;ABC123&#8217; can be combined to 1 + 2 = 3. So this numberplate is good.
&#8216;ABC129&#8217; 1 and 2 cannot be combined to give 9 using the four rules of arithmetics, so this does not work.</p>

<p>Do not count multiple times if more than one rule of arithmetics work.</p>

<p>Answer with the number of numberplates.</p>
