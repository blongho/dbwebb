<h1>Lab 1 - python</h1>
<p>If you need to peek at examples or just want to know more, take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">Python manual</a>.</p>

<p>There you will find everything this lab will go through and much more.</p>


<h2>1. Integers, floats and basic arithmetics</h2>
<p>The foundation of numbers and basic arithmetic.</p>


<h3>Exercise 1.1 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create a variable called <code>num_one</code> and give it the value 38.</p>

<p>Answer with the value of <code>num_one</code>.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.2 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create another variable called <code>num_two</code> and give it the value 78. Create a third variable called <code>result</code> and assign to it the sum of the first two variables.</p>

<p>Answer with the <code>result</code> variable.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.3 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create a variable called <code>num_three</code> and give it the value 70.</p>

<p>Create another variable called <code>num_four</code> and give it the value 26.</p>

<p>Subtract <code>num_three</code> from <code>num_four</code> and add the <code>result</code> variable from above to result of the subtraction. Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.4 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Answer with the result of a multiplication of <code>num_one</code> and <code>num_three</code>.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.5 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create a variable called <code>float_one</code> and give it the value 31.3.</p>

<p>Create another variable called <code>float_two</code> and give it the value 21.86.</p>

<p>Sum the two values and answer with the result, rounded to two decimals.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.6 (1 points)</h3>
<p>All variables used in the exercise below are defined above.</p>

<p>Sum <code>num_three</code> with <code>num_one</code> and subtract <code>num_four</code>. Multiply the result by <code>num_two</code>, add <code>float_two</code> and subtract <code>float_one</code>.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>







<h2>2. Strings and concatenation</h2>



<h3>Exercise 2.1 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Concatenate (svenska: konkatenera) the two words &#8216;storage&#8217; and &#8216;icecream&#8217; and answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.2 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Concatenate the word &#8216;icecream&#8217; with the integer 38 with a space between the two variables and answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.3 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Concatenate the integer 38 with the word &#8216;storage&#8217; with a space between. To the resulting string concatenate the string &#8217; and &#8216;. To this string concatenate integer 78 and the word &#8216;icecream&#8217; with a space between between the two variables.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.4 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Assign the string value &#8216;30&#8217; to a variable called <code>string_number</code> and assign the integer value 5 to a variable called <code>actual_number</code>.</p>

<p>Use <code>int()</code> to change the type of <code>string_number</code> to an integer and divide the integer value with <code>actual_number</code>. Answer with an integer by using the function <code>round()</code>.</p>







<h2>3. Extra assignments</h2>
<p>These questions are worth 3 points each. Solve them for extra points.</p>


<h3>Exercise 3.1 (3 points)</h3>
<p>Two large and one small pumps can fill a swimming pool in four hours. One large and three small pumps can also fill the same swimming pool in four hours. How many minutes will it take four large and four small pumps to fill the swimming pool?</p>

<p>(We assume that all large pumps are similar and all small pumps are also similar.)</p>

<p>Answer with the number of minutes.</p>






<h3>Exercise 3.2 (3 points)</h3>
<p>Peter has the phonenumber &#8216;0731415926&#8217; and Anders has the phonenumber &#8216;0727182818&#8217;. They call each other every sunday afternoon for 9 minutes. Calculate the number of hours that they talk with each other pr year (assume 52 sundays pr year). Use that number in a string concatenation with the following format: &#8216;Peter calls from [#Peter&#8217;s phonenumber] to Anders on [#Anders&#8217;s phonenumber] for [#hours] hours every year.&#8217; Replace the content inside [#] with the corresponding values.</p>

<p>Answer with the concatenated string.</p>
